I am Linnea / Polkapetunian. I love the MERN stack, bright colors and handicraft. I live in Sweden.

## Who is Polkapetunian?

It is my creative colorful alter ego. A petunia is a type of flower you grow for decorative purposes. In Sweden they are common in summer planters. It exists in bold colors such as red, pink and lilac. There's a striped red and white version I (and other Swedes ???) refer to as polkapetunia (polka petunia) because it resembles the Swedish mint candy polkagris (means "polka pig"!), which is also striped in red and white. As a matter of fact my birth name is Linn√©a which is also the name of a tiny light pink flower that grows in the boreal forest of Sweden. So I thought it very appropriate to adopt a nickname which is also a flower but of a more bold sort. =) I do love bold colors and red and white is one of my favourite combinations. It started when I made jewellery that resembled "polkagris", in Fimo clay. Check out Polkapetunian on Instagram if you are curious! ;)
